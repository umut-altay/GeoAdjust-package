\usage{
estimateModel(data = NULL, nNodes = NULL, options = NULL, priors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data input list that is created by prepareInput() function.}

\item{nNodes}{number of mesh nodes.}

\item{options}{A list containing two components, namely, random and covariates, representing the spatial random field and covariates.
Values of 1 and 0 turn the accounting for jittering in these components on and off.}

\item{priors}{A list containing two components, namely "beta" and "range". Beta is a vector of two elements and passes the parameters of the Gaussian prior that will be assigned
to the covariates (including the intercept). The first element of it is the mean and the second one is the
standard deviation of Gaussian prior. Range is a value representing the median range in kilometers, which will be used for constructing the PC (Penalized-complexity) priors.}
}
\value{
Model estimation results of class called res. The output consists of four elements:
A data frame containing the estimated model parameters and the corresponding 95% credible interval lengths,
The optimized core model object from autodifferentiation of TMB,
A matrix containing the sampled coefficient effect sizes and the random effect coefficients,
A character string indicating the likelihood type in the model.
