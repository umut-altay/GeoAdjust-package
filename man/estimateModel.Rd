\usage{
estimateModel(data = NULL, options = NULL, priors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{options}{A list containing two components, namely "random" and " covariates", representing the spatial random field and covariates.
Values of 1 and 0 turn the accounting for jittering in these components on and off.
Example usage : options = list(random = 0, covariates = 1) --> then jittering is accounted for only in the covariates.}

\item{priors}{A list containing two components, namely "beta" and "range". Beta is a vector of two elements and passes the parameters of the Gaussian prior that will be assigned
to the covariates (including the intercept). The first element of it is the mean and the second one is the
standard deviation of Gaussian prior. Range is a value representing the median range in kilometers, which will be used for constructing the PC (Penalized-complexity) priors.
Example usage : priors = list(beta = c(0,1), range = 114)}

\item{Data}{A data input list that is created by prepare_input() function}
}
\value{
A data frame called "res", containing the estimated model parameters, and "obj" which contains the required components for predictions
with the model (if wanted).
