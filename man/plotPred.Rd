\title{Plots the predictions and the corresponding uncertainty (coefficient of
variation)}
\usage{
plotPred(
  pred = NULL,
  predRaster = NULL,
  admin0 = NULL,
  admin1 = NULL,
  admin2 = NULL,
  rmPoly = NULL,
  target_crs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{A matrix that is the output of predRes() function.}

\item{predRaster}{The prediction raster that is constructed by the
gridCountry() function.}

\item{admin0}{An sf class MULTIPOLYGON representing the national level (admin0)
borders of the country.}

\item{admin1}{An sf class MULTIPOLYGON representing the first level (admin1)
subnational borders of the country.}

\item{admin2}{An sf class MULTIPOLYGON representing the second level (admin2)
subnational borders of the country.}

\item{rmPoly}{A number referring to the ID number of the admin2 level polygon
that needs to be left uncolored. It can be set to NULL as well.}

\item{locObs}{An sf class POINT object containing the coordinates of the
observation points (DHS locations). It should contain crs information.}
}
\value{
A list of two ggplot objects. One of them (ggPred) shows the median
predictions and the other one (ggUncertainty) shows the
corresponding coefficient of variations across the country, respectively.
