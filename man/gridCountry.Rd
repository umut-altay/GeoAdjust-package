\item{admin0}{A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object representing the national (admin0) level borders of the country.}

\item{res}{A value representing the resolution in kilometers.}
}
\value{
A list. The first element of the list, predRast, is the prediction raster. The second element of the list, loc.pred, is a data frame containing the grid of coordinates of the cell centers (both in degrees and in kilometers) of the prediction raster.
