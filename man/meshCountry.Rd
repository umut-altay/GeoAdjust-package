\title{Creates a constrained refined Delaunay triangulation mesh based on the country borders.}
\usage{
meshCountry(
  admin0 = NULL,
  max.edge = NULL,
  cutoff = NULL,
  offset = NULL,
  target_crs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{admin0}{An sf class multipolygon representing the country borders.}

\item{max.edge}{A vector of two values. The first and the second elements of
the vector represent the largest allowed triangle lengths for the inner and
outer mesh, respectively.}

\item{cutoff}{The minimum allowed distance of the vertices to each other.}

\item{offset}{A value representing the extension distance for the mesh.}

\item{target_crs}{A projection string representing the desired coordinate
reference system according to which the mesh will be constructed. The
measurement unit of the target_crs should be in kilometers.}
}
\value{
A constrained refined Delaunay triangulation mesh created based on
the country borders.
}
